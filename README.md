# open-fdd

## This is a Python based FDD tool for running fault equations defined by ASHRAE Guideline 36 for HVAC systems across historical datasets with the Pandas computing
library. G36 for air handling units (AHU's) there are 15 fault equations the first 13 of which are broken into seperate .py files, see ahu sub folder.

###### Note - Fault equations expect a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for a control system analog output that is typically expressed in industry HVAC controls as a percentage between 0 and 100% of command. 
Examples of a analog output could a heating valve, air damper, or fan VFD speed. For sensor input data these can be either float or integer based. Boolean on or off data for control system 
binary commands the fault equation expects an integer of 0 for Off and 1 for On.

## Reference AHU fault equations here defined by ASHRAE Guideline 36:
https://github.com/bbartling/open-fdd/tree/master/air_handling_unit/images

###### To get started git clone this repo and run the .py files in this fashion with specifying a data input argument `i` and a output argument `o` which will be the name of the report Word document that can be retrieved from the `final_report` directory after the script executes. Fault equation 6 is used as example on how to run a script:

`$ python ./fc6.py -i ./ahu_data/hvac_random_fake_data/fc6_fake_data1.csv -o fake1_ahu_fc6_report`

###### Each fc.py file contains a `FaultCondition` and a `FaultCodeReport` class. The `FaultCondition` class returns a new Pandas dataframe with the fault flag as a new column. Some faults as defined by ASHRAE are only active in certain AHU operating states like an AHU heating (OS #1), economizer (OS #2), economizer + mechanical cooling (OS #3), or a mechanical cooling mode (OS #4). This Python library (to be available on Pypi in the future) internally handles to ignore fault flags if the given fault flag is only to be active in a given AHU operating state (OS) or a combinations of OS modes.

###### Under the hood of a `FaultCondition` class a method (Python function inside a class) called `apply` looks like this below as an example shown for the fault condition 1 which returns the boolean flag as a Pandas dataframe column (`fc1_flag`) if the fault condition is present:
```python
def apply(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df['static_check_'] = (
        df[self.duct_static_col] < df[self.duct_static_setpoint_col] - self.duct_static_inches_err_thres)
    df['fan_check_'] = (df[self.supply_vfd_speed_col] >=
                        self.vfd_speed_percent_max - self.vfd_speed_percent_err_thres)

    df["fc1_flag"] = (df['static_check_'] & df['fan_check_']).astype(int)

    if self.troubleshoot:
        print("Troubleshoot mode enabled - not removing helper columns")

    else:
        del df['static_check_']
        del df['fan_check_']

    return df
```
	
###### A report is generated using the Python docx library from passing data into the `FaultCodeReport` class will output a Word document to a directory containing the following info, currently tested on a months worth of data.
* a description of the fault equation
* a snip of the fault equation as defined by ASHRAE
* a plot of the data created with matplotlib with sublots
* data statistics to show the amount of time that the data contains as well as elapsed in hours and percent of time for when the fault condition is `True` and elapsed time in hours for the fan motor runtime.
* a histagram representing the hour of the day for when the fault equation is `True`.
* sensor summary statistics filtered for when the AHU fan is running

###### For metric unit datasets reference the `params` screenshots inside the `images` directory link shown above. ERR_THRESHOLD parameters in the example.py files need to
modified accordlingly for metric units as defined in the `param` screenshots.

### Other caveats is G36 does not mention anything about if the AHU is running or not. It could be wise to ignore any faults created when the AHU is not running or fan status/command equals `False` or fan VFD speeds equal 0%. G36 also expects data to be on one minute intervals and that a 5 minute rolling average be used in the analysis. The rolling average is handled by the Pandas computing library when the data file in CSV format is read into memory:

```python
df = pd.read_csv(args.input,
                 index_col='Date',
                 parse_dates=True).rolling('5T').mean()
```
### More to come to incorporate G36 central cooling and heating plants (See PDF 2021 G36 that includes these equations in the PDF folder). Please submit a github issue or start a github conservation to request additional features. Pull requests encouraged to promote a community based free open source tool to help promote ASHRAE, HVAC optimization, and building carbon reduction efforts.
