Additional HVAC system types include chiller plants, boiler plants, fan coil units (FCUs), variable air volume (VAV) boxes, and heat pumps. Chiller plants are monitored for efficiency losses, compressor faults, and suboptimal cooling. Boiler plants are checked for inefficiencies, over/under heating, and cycling issues. VAV boxes are observed for damper positions, zone temperatures, and airflow rates. Heat pumps are analyzed to detect faults in reversing valves, defrost cycles, and heating/cooling efficiency.


## Chiller Plants
Fault Condition 1: Plant Operating in low ambiant outdoor air conditions not requiring mechanical cooling.
Fault Condition 2: Low delta T on building loop or evaporator side inlet and outlet temperature sensors.
Fault Condition 3: High condenser water temperature indicating possible fouling or load issues.
Fault Condition 4: Low evaporator temperature suggesting potential refrigerant issues.
Fault Condition 5: Excessive cycling of compressors indicating control or capacity problems.
Fault Condition 6: Cooling tower optimization for fan speed and condensor water flow/temperature.
Fault Condition 7: I/O readings suggesting potential sensor or control issues.

## Boiler Plants
Fault Condition 1: Condensing boiler operating outside air ideal condensing conditions.
Fault Condition 2: Hot Water plant does not keep up to demand.
Fault Condition 3: Flue gas temperature too high indicating efficiency loss.
Fault Condition 4: Short cycling of boiler suggesting control issues or oversized equipment.
Fault Condition 5: Water temperature deviations from setpoints indicating control problems.
Fault Condition 6: I/O readings suggesting potential sensor or control issues.

## Variable Air Volume (VAV) Boxes
Fault Condition 1: Air flow not correlating with temperature demands.
Fault Condition 2: Air flow too high for unnocupied zone.
Fault Condition 3: Zone temperatures not meeting setpoint.
Fault Condition 4: I/O readings suggesting potential sensor or control issues.

## Heat Pumps
Fault Condition 1: Inefficient switching between heating and cooling modes.
Fault Condition 2: Defrost cycle issues causing extended heating times.
Fault Condition 3: Low refrigerant charge indicated by suboptimal performance in both modes.
Fault Condition 4: I/O readings suggesting potential sensor or control issues.
