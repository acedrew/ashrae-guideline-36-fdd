# TODO 

Highly experimential "black box" or maybe even "grey box" physics concept idea for fault detection. Can modeled data be used to flag faults?

## On a VAV AHU system with air cooled chiller example
Model components in the HVAC system.
1. Zone temperature on VAV boxes Vs actual zone air temperature. If actual is very far off from modeled, could there be an issue? Like the HVAC technician what would you check next?
2. AHU leaving air Vs Modeled and duct static pressure Vs Modeled. What would that yeild? Maybe there is an issue with the Chiller?
3. Chiller plant leaving temperature Vs Modeled?

Can something like this solve root cause analysis if the zone air temperature is not met?
